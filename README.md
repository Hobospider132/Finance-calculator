# Finance-calculator
V1: 
Finance calculator by Hobospider132
Capable of calculating tax, depreciation and compound/simple interest

Use -h when running to show all possible parameters
Currently it's completely CLI. Might work on bringing it to GUI
There is a cool loading bar at the start which can be skipped by use -f or --fast_start parameter

Tax function is not quite ready, still a WIP so this program is currently in early access, other features should work without issue
If anyone is willing to help out with making a GUI or fixing the tax bug please open a pull request and I'll review it. I'll remove this when the issues are resolved
Another option is messaging me on discord at Hobospider132#4056
